==========================
ARGO APPLICATIONSETS
==========================
- Automates the generation of Argo CD Applications with the ApplicationSet Controller
- The ApplicationSet controller is a part of Argo CD 
- ApplicationSets allows users to define a template for creating Argo CD Applications and 
  then dynamically instantiate these templates based on various parameters.


GENERATORS
-----------
- "Generators" in ApplicationSets dynamically create Argo CD Applications based on the criteria defined within them.

There are currently 8 types of generators in ArgoCD:
- List generator:
     Specifies a list of values (like cluster names, URLs, etc.) to create multiple applications.

- Cluster generator:
    Dynamically generates applications for every cluster registered in Argo CD, or those that match specified labels.

- Git generator:
    Uses a directory, file, or structured data in a Git repository to generate applications.

- Matrix generator
    Combines two or more generators to create a Cartesian product of their outputs, enabling complex deployment scenarios.

- Merge generator:
    combines parameters produced by the base (first) generator with matching parameter sets produced by subsequent generators.

- SCM Provider generator:
    Connects to SCM providers like GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket to create applications based on repository events.

- Pull Request generator
    Sses the API of an SCMaaS provider (eg GitHub/GitLab) to automatically discover open pull requests within an repository.

- Cluster Decision Resource generator
